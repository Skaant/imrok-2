export default `**A BOOK STORY DRAFT**

It's a kind of preparatory work
for book writing.

It features a story
or a composed set of poems,
so it naturally implements [BOOK](#book).

It is usually driven by [BOOK-SECTIONS](#book-section)
and [BOOK-PAGES](#book-page),
instead of directly [BOOK-EXTRACTS](#book-extract)
like [NOTEBOOK](#notebook).`
